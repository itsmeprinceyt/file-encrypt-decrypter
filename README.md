# File Encrypter/Decrypter
This project provides a simple command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting files using a symmetric key derived from a user-provided password. It leverages the `cryptography` library's Fernet implementation for secure encryption.

# `Purpose`
As an active open-source developer, managing .env files securely is crucial for me. Storing these sensitive files only on my local machine feels riskyâ€”what if my computer crashes or is lost? To mitigate this, I decided to create a simple Python script that encrypts my .env files. This way, I can safely push the encrypted files to my public repositories without worrying about exposing my secrets. I believe this is an effective and free solution to keep my environment variables secure while maintaining easy access and version control.

## Features
File Encryption: Securely encrypts any file using a password.
File Decryption: Decrypts previously encrypted files using the correct password.
Password-Derived Key: Generates a strong encryption key from your password using SHA256 hashing.
## Usage
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed and the necessary libraries. You can install the `cryptography` library using pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```
## Encrypting a File
To encrypt a file, use the encrypt action followed by the path to the file you want to encrypt and make sure your file is in the same directory in the `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py encrypt .env
```
After running the command, you'll be prompted to enter your "Handshake" (password):
```bash
Handshake:
```
Upon successful encryption, a new file with a `.prince` extension will be created (e.g., `.env.prince`).

## Decrypting a File
To decrypt a file, use the `decrypt` action followed by the path to the encrypted file (which should have the `.prince` extension):

```bash
python main.py decrypt .env.prince
```
Again, you'll be prompted for your "Handshake" (password):

```bash
Handshake:
```
If the password is correct, the original file will be restored (the `.prince` extension will be removed). If the password is incorrect, you'll see a `"nuh uh"` message.
